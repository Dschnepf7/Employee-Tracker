## Usage
First the user should open the terminal and run command "npm i" to install the necessary dependencies for the application.

To start the program, the user must open the integrated terminal and run the command: node server.js . This will bring up the main menu options. After executing a command through the main menu, the user will then have to use comman ctrl-c to close the application and reinvoke using node server.js once again. In the future, functionality to streamline this process will be a focal point of improving the application.
